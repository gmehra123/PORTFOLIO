A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate.\\nNormal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It states that, under some conditions, the average of many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases. Therefore, physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are nearly normal.\\nMoreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties that are valuable in analytic studies. For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of independent normal deviates is a normal deviate. Many results and methods, such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting, can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed.\\nA normal distribution is sometimes informally called a bell curve. However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student's t, and logistic distributions). (For other names, see Naming.)\\nThe univariate probability distribution is generalized for vectors in the multivariate normal distribution and for matrices in the matrix normal distribution.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Multivariate normal distribution\\nSummary: In probability theory and statistics, the multivariate normal distribution, multivariate Gaussian distribution, or joint normal distribution is a generalization of the one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution to higher dimensions.  One definition is that a random vector is said to be k-variate normally distributed if every linear combination of its k components has a univariate normal distribution. Its importance derives mainly from the multivariate central limit theorem. The multivariate normal distribution is often used to describe, at least approximately, any set of (possibly) correlated real-valued random variables, each of which clusters around a mean value.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Log-normal distribution\\nSumm\", name='wikipedia', id='bba879fd-dfec-47a6-9359-8806d9082222', tool_call_id='call_QiesI9g7kX7w02VPAnkiRwfV')]\n",

They are particularly important due to the central limit theorem, which states that the average of many independently sampled random variables will tend to be normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the variables, as long as the number of samples is sufficiently large.\\n\\nIn practical applications, the normal distribution is characterized by its bell-shaped curve. While it is often informally referred to as a \"bell curve,\" other distributions can also exhibit bell shapes. A multivariate generalization of the normal distribution exists, which accommodates higher dimensions and is used to describe correlated real-valued random variables.\\n\\nThe properties of the normal distribution make it valuable for analytical studies in statistics, including tasks like uncertainty propagation and least squares fitting.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 301, 'prompt_tokens': 801, 'total_tokens': 1102, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c4585b5b9c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CuQhM0KPgoLinzWJF3zu2c9t0ReBe', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--f1d3bb06-9967-4f87-85fb-e37834ee7d01-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 801, 'output_tokens': 301, 'total_tokens': 1102, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]\n"
