        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Data and Analytics professional looking to solve business problems using statistics, Machine Learning and data centric approaches. 
            I have 6+ years of pricing and strategic intiatives experience. This page is a set of the blog articles I have written as case studies which address common business problems
             such as forecasting time series, simulating uncertainity with various scenarios and using clustering approaches to segmentation.</p>

            <h3>Hypothesis Testing and confidence intervals</h3>
            <p>In this project I work with the California housing dataset and do some exploratory data analysis. Also given the sample data,
                I genereate confidence intervals around estimates of key variables using <b>bootstrap</b> resampling. Finally I demonstrate how
                to formulate a hypothesis test and how to use <b>bootstrap</b> re-sampling to test the null hypothesis.

            <h3>Hypothesis Testing and ANOVA</h3>
            <p>This is part 2 of my hypothesis testing series. In this article I show practical examples of hypothesis testing,
                such as <b>test against a single value</b> and a <b>difference of means</b> test as well as an example of <b>ANOVA</b>

            <h3>Managing Attrition Introduction to survival analysis</h3>
            <p>In this blog post I talk about survival models that provide a very powerful way to model and study time to event. 
                The event can be a machine failure, loss of a customer (churn) or in the case of medical studies death after diagnosis.
                In particular I introduce Kaplan Meier curves that are <b>non-parametric</b> curves that help us explore the difference in survival
                between groups without assuming any distribution or parameters.

            <h3>Time Series Forecasting</h3>
            <p>This set of articles and projects is about the basics of Time Series forecasting using Moving Averages and 
                Holt winters method. In adittion I discuss how to decompose a time series into trend and seasonality and the
                difference between simple and exponential moving averages. The second article talks about seasonality <b>ARIMA</b>
                <b>SARIMA</b> and <b>SARIMAX</b> models.
