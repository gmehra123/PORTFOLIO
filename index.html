        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Data and Analytics leader with over 6 years of experience driving strategic initiatives and solving business problems through data-centric approaches. 
            My focus is on leveraging advanced machine learning, statistical analysis, and forecasting techniques to enable data-driven decision-making at the executive level. 
            This portfolio showcases my thought leadership in areas such as pricing strategy, customer segmentation, and business forecasting, and demonstrates how I’ve helped businesses achieve significant operational improvements</p>

            <h3>Hypothesis Testing and confidence intervals</h3>
            <p>In this project I work with the California housing dataset and do some exploratory data analysis. Also given the sample data,
                I genereate confidence intervals around estimates of key variables using <b>bootstrap</b> resampling. Finally I demonstrate how
                to formulate a hypothesis test and how to use <b>bootstrap</b> re-sampling to test the null hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p><b>Business Imapct:</b>This kind of analysis quantifies and conveys the degree of uncertainity around business metrics.
            Rather than using point estimates like avg Lifetime Value we can convey confidence intervals. For eg. We can say with 95% confidence
            that the true mean Lifetime Value is in the interavl from $350 to $375 rather than the mean Lifetime value is $340 </p>

            <h3>Hypothesis Testing and ANOVA</h3>
            <p>This is part 2 of my hypothesis testing series. In this article I show practical examples of hypothesis testing,
                such as <b>test against a single value</b> and a <b>difference of means</b> test as well as an example of <b>ANOVA</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Business Imapct:</b>This kind of analysis helps us formulate and and answer questions like are late packages truly
            heavier than packages that arrive on time. It also helps build confidence around our estimates. Even though off the shelf tools 
            are available but a good understanding of the process helps leaders ask the right questions </p>

            <h3>Managing Attrition Introduction to survival analysis</h3>
            <p>In this blog post I talk about survival models that provide a very powerful way to model and study time to event. 
                The event can be a machine failure, loss of a customer (churn) or in the case of medical studies death after diagnosis.
                In particular I introduce Kaplan Meier curves that are <b>non-parametric</b> curves that help us explore the difference in survival
                between groups without assuming any distribution or parameters.
            </p>
            <p><b>Business Imapct:</b>Kaplan-Meier curves help businesses understand how long customers or products last before an event like churn or failure occurs. 
                By revealing patterns in customer retention or product reliability, companies can make informed decisions to improve customer loyalty,increase lifetime value or optimize maintenance strategies.  </p>

            <h3>Beginner Friendly introduction to 3 useful tree based models</h3>
            <p>In this blog post I introduce three useful tree based models for classification and regression.
                I also introduce the concept of ensemble methods.
            
             <p><b>Business Imapct:</b>Tree based models and ensembles of models are increasingly being used in predictive anlytics. This

                Holt winters method. In adittion I discuss how to decompose a time series into trend and seasonality and the
                difference between simple and exponential moving averages. The second article talks about seasonality <b>ARIMA</b>
